                <p>In this project, I set out to use React to create a simple webpage that housed movies that I have seen, and allowed me to place them in a cart of 'my favorites'

                    <h3>Summary of Findings (what worked? what didn't?)</h3>
                    <p>
                        I discovered that the favoriting function was common across websites/apps that served different functions. In my comparison chart above, we have an e-commerce site (uniqlo), a music streaming site (spotify) and a social media platform (facebook). Facebook is iconic in this realm for pioneering the successful use of the ‚Äúlike‚Äù button. 
                        <br><br>
                        
                        The most successful feature of the uniqlo website was the visibility of the ‚Äúfavoriting‚Äù icon, and the ease of access to the favorites list (the ‚Äúwishlist‚Äù). However, I felt that the connection between the two features was unintuitive (it is unclear what the ‚Äúwishlist‚Äù tab was for, until a user clicks on a ‚Äúfavoriting‚Äù icon), and I disliked the fact that the user was only able to ‚Äúun-favorite‚Äù the icon within the wishlist.
                        <br><br>
                        The most successful feature of the spotify website is the visibility of the ‚Äúfavoriting‚Äù icon, especially since the fact that a user has liked a song would be visible throughout the app (as evidenced by a bright green filled heart icon). This allows the user to easily like/un-like songs, without having to enter the favorites list just to do that. On the other hand, I felt that the favorites list (the ‚ÄúLiked Songs‚Äù playlist) was not obviously and intuitively situated on the webpage. If a user has multiple playlists, the ‚ÄúLiked Songs‚Äù playlist would be relegated to the bottom of the pile of a user‚Äôs saved playlists. This makes it difficult for the user to quickly access and view all the songs that they have liked before. Additionally, users are unable to like entire albums/playlists, as the feature is only available to individual songs.
                        <br><br>
                        The most successful feature of the facebook website is the visibility of the ‚Äúfavoriting‚Äù icon, and the clear indications/tags that accompany it for the sake of informing users of its function. The user is also easily able to like/unlike posts by clicking on the ‚Äúfavoriting‚Äù icon attached to the item directly, instead of needing to navigate to a separate webpage. On the flip side, it was extremely difficult to find a user‚Äôs list of favorited items (it involved a 4-click process, which users would not intuitively be able to complete without the help of a search engine query), making the point of favoriting and aggregating these items less clear (unless we look at this issue from the company‚Äôs data collection perspective, rather than user interest).

                <h3>App Overview</h3>
                <p>I decided to create an app that stores movies that I have seen before, and allows me to place my 'favorites' in a favorites cart by the side of the same page.</p>
                <p>My app is able to filter movies by Year, Genre and Ratings, and can do any combination of these filters simultaneously. To reset the filters, simply click the "All Genres", "All Years" or "All Ratings" option at the top of each drop down menu.</p>
                <p>My app is also able to sort the movies by rating (high to low), or alphabetically by movie name (default). To reset the sort to the default option, simply toggle the sorting button.</p>
                <p>I have also designed it such that Filter and Sort can work together (eg. Sort by Ratings and Filter by Genre simultaneously).</p>
                <p>Each movie card comes with a 'like' button that can be clicked or unclicked to add the movie to your favorites cart. Unliking the card will automatically remove the movie from the cart, there is also a button in the cart to clear the entire cart of movies. There is an aggregator at the bottom of the cart that counts the number of movies in the favorites cart so far.</p>
